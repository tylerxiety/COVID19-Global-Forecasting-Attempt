# COVID19-Global-Forecasting-Attempt
Attempting the [Kaggle challenge on forecasting the COVID19 Global conformed and death cases](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5)

# Problem Statement
A quantile regression problem

# Evaluation Score

[Weighted Pinball Loss](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5/overview/evaluation) 

# Solution (to be continued)

## Ideas for models:

1. Quantile gradient boosting regressor from sklearn (to be continued)

- Not sure the 'quantile' loss function defined in the model

2. Quantile deep net using Keras or Tensorflow APIs (to be continued)

3. Quantile regression forests from skargen (to be continued)

4. Quntile linear regression from mlinsights (to be continued)


## Ideas for the missing values (to be continued):
1. drop
2. impute
3. impute with mark on which ones are imputed

## Ideas for the columns (to be continued):
1. County: drop or keep
2. Province_State: drop or keep
3. Population: bins or as is
4. Date: day of week, day of month, month, day of year
5. relationship b/w confirmed and death?
6. New columns:Continuent ?
